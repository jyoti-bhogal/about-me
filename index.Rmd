**Statistician | Software Community Manager | SSI Fellow 2025**

Jyoti Bhogal is a trained statistician, community builder, and Research Software Engineering (RSE) advocate with a strong foundation in data and open science. A first-generation STEM graduate, Jyoti’s academic journey—from earning multiple merit-based scholarships to completing a Master's in Statistics—laid the groundwork for her career in research and software. Her curiosity for open-source tools led her to the R community, and eventually into global RSE movements. As the Co-Lead of the RSE Asia Association, she has played a pioneering role in amplifying the voices and visibility of RSEs in the Asian region. Over the past four years, Jyoti has led numerous community events, cross-continental collaborations, and research studies, including her 2025 Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship.
